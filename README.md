## 🎯 Key Metrics & Results 

1.  *Profitability (VAN/IRR):*
    * Assesses the project's ability to generate value, yielding an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of *224.66%*.

2.  *Risk Assessment (Standard Deviation):*
    * Uses NumPy's Standard Deviation (np.std) to quantify volatility and assess the stability of returns.
    * *Results:* Project A (High Risk) = *0.0707* vs. Project B (Stable) = *0.0141*.
